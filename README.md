# acmetool

A fork of [acmetool] for use at Kapsi Internet-käyttäjät ry.
This version is modified to use paths suitable for a shared deployment
where each user runs acmetool as non-root from a global installation.
Kapsi has a system set up that picks up certificates and installs them
automatically.
